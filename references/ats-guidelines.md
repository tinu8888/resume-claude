# ATS guidelines and scoring rubric

This is the shared reference for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) quality in this workspace. The `/atscheck` skill scores against it, `/jobupdate` uses it for its ATS score, and the LaTeX template is built to pass it. The numbers mirror what public checkers (Resume Worded, Jobscan, Enhancv) report.

## How an ATS reads a resume

An ATS parses the **text layer** of your PDF, not the visual layout. So the test that matters is: run `pdftotext` on the PDF and read what comes out. If a section, a date, or your phone number isn't in that text, the ATS can't see it either.

```
pdftotext -layout path/to/resume.pdf -    # human-readable extraction
pdftotext path/to/resume.pdf -            # raw reading order, closer to ATS parse
```

If `pdftotext` returns little or no text, the resume is image-based and most ATS will reject it. (Resumes built by this workspace are always text-based, so this only bites if someone checks an external PDF.)

## What ATS checkers score (five categories)

### 1. Keyword and skills match against the job description (highest weight)
The ATS matches your resume against the JD: hard skills, tools, certifications, job titles, and industry terms. It looks at whether the term is present, where it appears, and how it's phrased. Use the JD's exact wording for tools you actually use ("PostgreSQL" not "Postgres" if the JD says PostgreSQL). Only ever claim skills the candidate genuinely has.

### 2. Formatting and parseability
Simple single-column layouts with standard section headings parse best. Things that break ATS parsing:
- Tables, text boxes, and multiple columns for content
- Images, logos, icons, charts
- Content inside headers/footers (many ATS strip these)
- Non-standard fonts or heavy graphics
- Skills shown only as bars or ratings instead of words

Safe choices: single column, standard fonts (Arial/Helvetica/Calibri), real text bullets, PDF file type.

### 3. Section completeness
Standard, clearly named sections the ATS expects: Summary, Experience, Education, Skills. Each job needs a title, company, location, and dates. Use conventional headings ("Experience," not "Where I've Made an Impact").

### 4. Content quality
Quantified achievements (numbers, %, $, time saved), strong past-tense action verbs (Built, Led, Shipped, Reduced), and concrete results rather than duties. This is the part a human recruiter also reads, so it counts twice.

### 5. Contact and basics
Email, phone, location, and a LinkedIn URL, all as plain text in the body (not in a header/footer or image).

## Scoring rubric (0 to 100)

When a JD is provided, weight the categories like this:

| Category | Weight |
|---|---|
| Keyword / skills match vs JD | 40 |
| Formatting and parseability | 20 |
| Section completeness | 15 |
| Content quality (quantification, action verbs) | 15 |
| Contact and basics | 10 |

When no JD is provided, drop the keyword weight and spread it across the rest (formatting 30, sections 25, content 30, contact 15), and judge keywords as "are role-relevant skills present and specific" rather than matched to a posting.

## Benchmarks

- **75 to 100**: strong. Well aligned, likely to pass ATS and reach a recruiter.
- **60 to 74**: readable but has gaps. Missing keywords or minor formatting/content issues.
- **Below 60**: likely filtered out before a human sees it. Fix before applying.

## The honesty rule still applies

A high ATS score never justifies adding skills or experience the candidate doesn't have. If the JD wants a keyword that isn't true for them, the score stays lower. Raise it by surfacing real, relevant experience and using the JD's exact terms for things they've actually done, never by inventing matches.

## Why resumes from this workspace already score well

The LaTeX template (`resume/master/resume_template.tex`) is built to pass category 2 by default:
- Single column, standard fonts, real text bullets, text-based PDF
- Standard section headings
- Empty header/footer (no content the ATS would strip)
- Dates, titles, companies as plain text

So the work in `/jobupdate` and `/atscheck` is mostly categories 1, 4, and 5: keywords, quantification, and completeness.
